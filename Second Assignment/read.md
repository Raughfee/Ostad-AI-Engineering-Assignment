Modules: Pandas | NumPy | Metrics

Part 1: NumPy â€“ Numerical Computing (30 Marks)
Task 1: Array Creation and Operations (15 Marks)
Create the following arrays:


A 1D array of integers from 0 to 20.


A 2D array of shape (4, 5) filled with random integers from 10 to 99.


A 3x3 identity matrix.


Perform the following operations:


Find the mean, median, and standard deviation of the 2D array.


Slice and print the second row and third column of the 2D array.


Multiply two arrays element-wise.


Deliverable: Python code and printed outputs with comments

Task 2: Broadcasting and Reshaping (15 Marks)
Reshape a 1D array of size 16 into a 4x4 matrix.


Add a 1D array [1, 2, 3, 4] to each row of the matrix using broadcasting.


Flatten the matrix back to a 1D array.


Deliverable: Code with explanations

Part 2: Pandas â€“ Data Manipulation (40 Marks)
Task 3: Working with DataFrames (20 Marks)
Create a DataFrame with the following data:


Name
Age
Department
Salary
Alice
25
IT
50000
Bob
30
HR
45000
Charlie
28
IT
72000
Diana
35
Marketing
58000
Evan
40
HR
60000

Perform these operations:


Add a new column Bonus = 10% of Salary.


Filter and display employees in the HR department.


Calculate average salary by department.


Save the DataFrame to a CSV file.


Deliverable: Python code and resulting DataFrame

Task 4: Data Cleaning & Analysis (20 Marks)
Use any public CSV dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or UCI ML Repository)
Load the dataset using pandas.read_csv()


Show:


First 5 and last 5 rows


Shape of dataset


Columns and their data types


Handle missing values (e.g., fill, drop)


Generate basic statistics using .describe()


Deliverable: Cleaned dataset and code

Part 3: Classification Evaluation with Confusion Matrix (30 Marks)
Task 5: Dataset-Based Classification Evaluation (30 Marks)
ðŸ”¹ Dataset:
Use the Iris Dataset from sklearn.datasets, but modify it into a binary classification problem:
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
import pandas as pd

# Load Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
df = pd.DataFrame(iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
df['target'] = iris.target

# Convert to binary classification (classify Versicolor vs not-Versicolor)
df['binary_target'] = (df['target'] == 1).astype(int)
ðŸ”¹ Documentation:  https://scikit-learn.org/stable/api/sklearn.metrics.html#classification-metrics 
ðŸ”¹ Steps to Perform:
Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 70/30 split).


Train a simple Logistic Regression classifier.


Use the model to make predictions on the test set.


Generate the Confusion Matrix using sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.


Calculate and display the following metrics:


Accuracy


Precision


Recall


F1-Score


Print or display results clearly, and add a brief explanation of what each metric means.


Sample Code Reference (for guidance):
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

# Train-test split
X = df[iris.feature_names]
y = df['binary_target']
[todo]

# Train model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluation
[todo]

ðŸ“¤ Deliverables:
Python code and output for:


Confusion matrix (as a table or printed array)


All 4 metrics


Short explanation of each metric


Submission Guidelines
Format: Notebook Link (Google Colab/Kaggle)
Instruction: Outputs must be visible
